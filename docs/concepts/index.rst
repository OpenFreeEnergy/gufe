Core Concepts
=============

Gufe exists to define interoperable APIs for free energy calculations, which
can be used by an ecosystem of Python packages to develop tools that focus
on performing specific aspects of the free energy pipeline, while
benefitting from other tools for other aspects.

In order to do this, gufe distinguishes several aspects of the process of
calculating free energies, and define APIs for each of them. Gufe provides
the underlying infrastructure; the real science is done in packages that
implement parts of the gufe APIs.
