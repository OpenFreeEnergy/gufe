# `templates` directory

This directory is appended to the `templates_path` Sphinx config variable in `conf.py`. Jinja templates in this directory are available to Sphinx. This is used to provide an Autosummary template that supports an automatic API reference.

Note that templates used for the *theme itself* are not placed in this directory!
