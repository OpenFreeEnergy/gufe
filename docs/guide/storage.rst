The GUFE Storage System
=======================

Storage lifetimes
-----------------

The storage system in GUFE is heavily tied to the GUFE protocol system. The
key concept here is that the different levels of the GUFE protocol system;
campaign, DAG, and unit; inherently imply different lifetimes for the data
that is created. Those different lifetimes define the stages of the GUFE
storage system.

In an abstract sense, as used by protocol developers, these three levels
correspond to three lifetimes of data:

* ``scratch``: This is temporary data that is only needed for the lifetime
  of a :class:`.ProtocolUnit`. This data is not guaranteed to be available
  beyown the single :class:`.ProtocolUnit` where it is created, but may be
  reused within that :class:`.ProtocolUnit`.
* ``shared``: This is data that is shared between different units in a
  :class:`.ProtocolDAG`. For example, a single equilibration stage might be
  shared between multiple production runs. The output snapshot of the
  equilibration would be suitable for as something to put in ``shared``
  data. This data is guarateed to be present from when it is created until
  the end of the :class:`.ProtocolDAG`, but is not guaranteed to exist after
  the :class:`.ProtocolDAG` terminates.
* ``permanent``: This is the data that will be needed beyond the scope of a
  single rough estimate of the calculation. This could include anything that
  an extension of the simulation would require, or things that require
  network-scale analysis. Anything stored here will be usable after the
  calculation has completed.

The ``scratch`` area is always a local directory. However, ``shared`` and
``permanent`` can be external (remote) resources, using the
:class:`.ExternalResource` API.

As a practical matter, the GUFE storage system can be handled with a
:class:`.StorageManager`. This automates some aspects of the transfer
between stages of the GUFE storage system, and simplifies the API for
protocol authors.  In detail, this provides protocol authors with
``PathLike`` objects for ``scratch``, ``shared``, and ``permanent``. All
three of these objects actually point to special subdirectories of the
scratch space for a specific unit, but are managed by context manangers at
the executor level, which handle the process of moving objects from local
directories to the actual ``shared`` and ``permanent`` locations, which can
be external resources.


External resource utilities
---------------------------

For flexible data storage, GUFE defines the :class:`.ExternalResource` API,
which allows data be stored/loaded in a way that is agnostic to the
underlying data store, as long as the store can be represented as a
key-value store. Withing GUFE, we provide several examples, including
:class:`.FileStorage` and :class:`.MemoryStorage` (primarily useful for
testing.) The specific ``shared`` and ``permanent`` resources, as provided
to the executor, can be instances of an :class:`.ExternalResource`.

.. note::

   The ``shared`` space must be a resource where an uploaded object is
   instantaneously available, otherwise later protocol units may fail if the
   shared result is unavailable. This means that files or approaches based
   on ``scp`` or ``sftp`` are fine, but things like cloud storage, where the
   existence of a new document may take time to propagate through the
   network, are not recommended for ``shared``.


Details: Manangement of the Storage Lifetime
--------------------------------------------

The concepts of the storage lifetimes are important for protocol authors,
but details of implementation are left to the specific executor. In order to
facilitate correct treatment of the storage lifecycle, GUFE provides a few
helpers. The information in this section is mostly of interest to authors of
executors. The helpers are:

* :class:`.StorageManager`: This is the overall fa√ßade interface for
  interacting with the rest of the storage lifecycle tools.
* ``DAGContextManager``:
* :class:`.StagingDirectory`:
* :class:`.StagingPath`:

In practice, the executor uses the :class:`.StorageManager` to create a
:class:`.DAGContextManager` at the level of a DAG, and then uses the
:class:`.DAGContextManager` to create a context to run a unit. That context
creates a :class:`.SharedStaging` and a :class:`.PermanentStaging`
associated with the specific unit. Those staging directories, with the
scratch directory, are provided to the :class:`.ProtocolDAGUnit`, so that
these are the only objects protocol authors need to interact with.

In using these, we assume that the label for data from a given unit is of
the form ``$DAG/$UNIT_INFO/$FILEPATH``. The details of ``$DAG`` and
``$UNIT_INFO`` are up the executor; in particular, there may be a more
deeply nested hierarchy for the ``$UNIT_INFO`` (e.g., to account for retries
of a given unit). An executor that wants to use a data label that doesnt'
match this format should not use :class:`.StorageManager` and the related
tools.
